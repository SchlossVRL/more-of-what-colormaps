## FOLDER: Stimuli-colormaps

Stores experiment colormap stimuli and legend colorscale stimuli


### Colormap images are saved with the following convention: 
color scale name (ColorBrewerBlue, Hot) _ background color (white) _ which side was dark (left, right) _ unique colormap number (0-19)

There are also a few "Edited" colormaps, which include labels above the maps (e.g., "Observation Site 1), and below ("Left Side/ Right Side"). These maps were used for the instruction pages. 


### Legend images are saved with the following convention: 
legend _ color scale name (ColorBrewerBlue, hot) _ location of darker end (dark high, dark low)
