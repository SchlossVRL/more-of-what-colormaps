# More of what: dissociating effects of conceptual and numeric mappings on interpreting colormap data visualizations

_Alexis Soto, Melissa A. Schoenlein, Karen B. Schloss_

Colormap data visualizations show patterns in data by mapping variations in color to variations in magnitude. When people interpret colormap data visualizations, they have expectations about how colors map to quantities of data, and they are better at interpreting visualizations that align with those expectations. For example, they infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias) and colors that are higher on vertically oriented legends map to larger quantities (high-is-more bias). In previous studies, the notion of quantity was straightforward because more of the concept represented (conceptual magnitude) corresponded to larger numeric values (numeric magnitude). However, conflicts can arise between conceptual and numeric magnitude, such as rank orderings to quantify healthâ€”smaller numbers correspond to greater heath. Under such conflicts, do biases like the dark-is-more bias operate at the level of the conceptual or numeric magnitude? We addressed this question across five experiments, spanning data types and domains: response times of alien animals to notice scientists (Experiments 1-3), response times of microbes to eliminate pathogens (Experiment 4), and health metrics across counties (Experiment 5). Across all experiments, the high-is-more bias consistently operated at the conceptual level. The dark-is-more bias tended to operate at the level of conceptual magnitude, but numeric magnitude interfered, and overrode conceptual magnitude when conceptual magnitude was less salient. These results simultaneously (a) provide insight into factors influencing how people infer meaning from visual features, and (b) emphasize the need to consider data meaning, not just numbers, when designing visualizations aimed to facilitate visual communication.

## FOLDER: 1. Organizing-R

### Data files

`Exp1.csv`, `Exp2.csv`, `Exp3.csv`, `Exp4.csv`, `Exp5.csv`: store the individual trial data from the colormaps task


### Analysis file

`ColormapWhat-dataProcessing.R`: R script for cleaning and organizing raw data. Takes files above as inputs. Creates a csv file for each participant that gets stored in the respective subfolder

### Subfolders
Each subfolder stores the output of the ColormapWhat-dataProcessing.R code - two files for each participant, one for their accuracy and one for their response times. These files are used as input into the Exp#_LoadInData_MAS.m files. 



## FOLDER: 2. Plotting-Matlab

### Data files

`Exp1.mat`, `Exp2.mat`, `Exp3.mat`, `Exp4.mat`, `Exp5.mat`: store processed data from Exp#_LoadInData_MAS.m files. Used as input into Exp#_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m files


### Analysis and plotting files

`COLORMAPS_MAIN_MAS.m`: main MATLAB script that calls sub-files/functions to process and plot data

`Exp1_LoadInData_MAS.m`, `Exp2_LoadInData_MAS.m`, `Exp3_LoadInData_MAS.m`, `Exp4_LoadInData_MAS.m`, `Exp5_LoadInData_MAS.m`: processes individual experiment trial data created from the ColormapWhat-dataProcessing.R code. 

`Exp1_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m`, `Exp2_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m`,`Exp3_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m`,`Exp4_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m`,`Exp5_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m`: Create .csv files used for SPSS analyses (currently commented out)

`PruneRTs_MAS.m`: processes RT data for each partiicpant. Identifies and excludes trials in which particpant's RT was +-2 SD from their mean 

`PlotColormaps_MAS_CongXLegend.m`: plots congruency condition X legend orientation (averaged over lightness encoded mapping and color scale)

`PlotColormaps_MAS_CongXMapping.m`:  plots congruency condition X lightness encoded mapping (averaged over congruency and color scale)

`PlotColormaps_MAS_CongXMappingXLegend.m`: plots congruency condition X lightness encoded mapping X legend orientation (averaged over color scale)

`PlotColormaps_MAS_CongXMappingXLegendXScale.m`: plots congruency condition X lightness encoded mapping X legend orientation X color scale


`PlotColormaps_MAS.m`: creates some plots, but primarily used for organizing data to create output files used for SPSS (need to uncomment some text in the Exp#_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m files)

`PlotColormapsRank_MAS.m`: creates some plots, but primarily used for organizing data to create output files used for SPSS (need to uncomment some text in the Exp5_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m files)



## FOLDER: 3. Analyzing-SPSS

`Exp1_SPSS_outAll.csv`, `Exp2_SPSS_outAll.csv`, `Exp3_SPSS_outAll.csv`,`Exp4_SPSS_outAll.csv`,`Exp5_SPSS_outAll.csv`: store response time data output from the Exp#_OrganizeColormapSpace_MAS.m files. Used for analyzing data. 


### Analysis file

`ColormapWhat-Analyses.sps` SPSS script file to run analyses. Uses above csv files as input
